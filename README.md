# SaaS

This project contains public API definitions used in [pmm-managed](https://github.com/percona/pmm-managed/). Code evolving on top of and consuming this will be used for a cloud-based SaaS solution for [PMM](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management).

Check out the [PMM  documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html) for currently available features.
